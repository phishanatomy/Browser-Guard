# Browser Guard
Protect browsers from accessing untrusted websites. A browser extension for the paranoid.

## How it Works
Browser Guard intercepts all top-level navigation requests and checks if the destination is on your list of trusted domains. If it is not found, the request is blocked, and you're given the option to temporarily or permanently trust the domain.

## How to Install Browser Guard
Browser Guard is currently pending in several browser extension stores. A direct link will be provided here once it is listed there. For now, you can download one of the releases and manually install it in your browser of choice, assuming you use one of the following:
 - Firefox
 - Chrome
 - A Chrome-based browser

You can also clone the repository, build the TypeScript files yourself, and install the extension using the `/src` directory in your repository.

## Privacy
Browser Guard takes your privacy seriously. No data is collected by Browser Guard at any point, and no connections are ever made to any remote servers.
